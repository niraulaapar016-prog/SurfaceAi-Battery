This is my first repository where i will work on my 100 day challenge . Here, I will work on  Force-Field Molecular Dynamics (FFMD) and Machine Learning, I want to simulate and predict these Li⁺ hopping mechanisms, correlate them with ionic conductivity, and ultimately design LLZO–polymer systems that are both stable and fast-conducting — without needing endless synthesis trials.
